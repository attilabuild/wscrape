You were wrestling “Mr Wonderful”, Paul Orndorff that night in the main event. You were shocked and so happy after the match because you told me that was your very last headband and if it weren’t for me, you’d have no way of getting that exact one made again. You promised me that you would get more made and give me a Hulkster headband of my own as a thank you gift. \n\nA month later in Madison Square Garden, you did just that.

      "transcript": "Rest in Peace, Terry Bollea aka The Immortal Hulk Hogan 🕊️💐 \n\nTo millions of little kids you were a childhood hero - myself included. \nIn 1984, I gave you your “HULKSTER” headband back, in the locker room in Madison Square Garden - I was the lucky kid caught it when you threw it in the crowd. You were wrestling “Mr Wonderful”, Paul Orndorff that night in the main event. You were shocked and so happy after the match because you told me that was your very last headband and if it weren’t for me, you’d have no way of getting that exact one made again. You promised me that you would get more made and give me a Hulkster headband of my own as a thank you gift. \n\nA month later in Madison Square Garden, you did just that. You kept your word, with a handshake and a “thanks kid”. \nAnd that meant the world to that little 12 year old boy. \n\nJust 17 years later, and still a kid at the age of 29 years old — I’m standing in the middle of the ring and facing you - one of my wrestling heroes in the main event of WRESTLEMANIA. \n\nThe match was to decide who would go down in history, as The Greatest of All Time. \n\nWhen you kick out of my Rock Bottom finisher - just listen and FEEL that crowd go ELECTRIC…\nall for you.

BUT…you opened the door for a big can of Go-Fuck-Yourself! \n\nThe very person who you are judging or looking down on for whatever reason just might dislike you even more than you dislike them! They just chose to kept their mouth shut because it served no point to verbalize their unsolicited opinion. I can guarantee you this, a lot of people hope you say something to them just so they can go the fuck off and say something right back to your ass. \n\nI happen to be one of those people and this man gave me the perfect opportunity to share with him my opinion and exactly what I thought of him. While my feelings were not hurt because I have become calloused to it, I could tell that he was taken aback by my truth to him. \n\nWhile it is great to have an opinion and stand for something, you best be sure your shit is tight before you verbalize it. It might be best in life when you have an opinion to either shut the fuck up or look at yourself real hard in the mirror before you open your fucking mouth. The return blows that you will receive might just be a lot more damaging than the ones you threw! \n\nStay hard!",

It is hard to judge yourself nowadays and see where you stand and how you measure up because the world is grading us all on a massive curve. Like in school, the curve is off of the highest grade. The problem today is that the world is grading us on a “C-“ curve, therefore a “D” doesn’t seem so bad! You think you are doing just fine. \n\nWhen I was lazy in school, living that mediocre life, when I got my “D’s”, I was happy because I knew a “D” was passing.

The second they go away, we go away. \n\nA lot of you think it is ok to be where you are and society tells you as much, mediocrity is too often rewarded.\n\nI am speaking from experience. It is hard to judge yourself nowadays and see where you stand and how you measure up because the world is grading us all on a massive curve. Like in school, the curve is off of the highest grade. The problem today is that the world is grading us on a “C-“ curve, therefore a “D” doesn’t seem so bad! You think you are doing just fine. \n\nWhen I was lazy in school, living that mediocre life, when I got my “D’s”, I was happy because I knew a “D” was passing. That is how pathetic the standard was that I set for myself. The bar was so fucking low. \n\nAs I look around me now, I see a lot of people happy with a “D” in life. \n\nStay hard!",

My mental wellness turned into my mental hellness.

I told @aaronsingerman to ask me whatever questions he had about me because he obviously heard a lot of negative things too in his dealing with members of the SEAL community. \n\nSadly, a lot of these same people already know the truth and are purposefully lying to defame my name and character. \n\nI never wanted to bust some of these motherfuckers out but when you back a motherfucking dog into a corner, at some point, you are gonna piss him off. \n\nI have some supposed “hero” from SEAL Team 6 DM’ing people saying that I was dishonorably discharged from the military- which is a total lie- along with so many other lies. He didn’t know he was DM’ing my lawyer!!! \n\nAll of this will make perfect sense to you after you listen to this podcast.\n\nA lot of these fraternities, like the SEALs, run in packs.

      "transcript": "I didn’t know @aaronsingerman and I didn’t know about this featured clip from his podcast where I was used as clickbait until it was brought to my attention. \n\nThis particular clip I am talking about got over 700k views on YouTube and I received a lot of embarrassing questions about it. \n\nAs Gandhi says, silence becomes cowardice when occasion demands speaking out the whole truth so here is my opportunity. \n\nI called Aaron who had this one particular Navy SEAL on his show where they ran their mouths about me and asked him to have me on so that I can answer his questions, not with lies but with the facts of my military service record as well as some private DMs exchanged with this very same person proving that they talk out of both sides of their mouth. \n\nSo unlike some of these bitches who have been running their mouths and lying, talking about how I never deployed, never went to combat, would go to military schools instead of combat, etc., I am taking it straight to them with the facts. I told @aaronsingerman to ask me whatever questions he had about me because he obviously heard a lot of negative things too in his dealing with members of the SEAL community. \n\nSadly, a lot of these same people already know the truth and are purposefully lying to defame my name and character. \n\nI never wanted to bust some of these motherfuckers out but when you back a motherfucking dog into a corner, at some point, you are gonna piss him off. \n\nI have some supposed “hero” from SEAL Team 6 DM’ing people saying that I was dishonorably discharged from the military- which is a total lie- along with so many other lies. He didn’t know he was DM’ing my lawyer!!! \n\nAll of this will make perfect sense to you after you listen to this podcast.\n\nA lot of these fraternities, like the SEALs, run in packs. When I found the truth out about a lot of them within the community, I decided to walk alone and this is the price I have paid.",

I'm calling it the WonderShyne Index. Shyne is the number one collector on Earth, he is really curating this with me. These cards are from all over the world, China, Asia, United States, all being domesticated here in a giant index. And what I'm planning to do is put it on display in museums on the East and West Coast around Father's Day. They can't be taken out of vaults. To get into this index, you better have the best card on Earth. When I start something, I go big!\n\nLearn More at 👉 securecollectibles.com",

Now here I am 32 years young doing tricks that I couldn’t even do in my prime. \n\nIt’s interesting how we’re conditioned to think our abilities peak in youth and inevitably decline with age, as if talent follows a strict timeline. I’ve realized that being good at something isn’t just a phase, it’s a rhythm and sometimes it just takes the right beat to bring it back into motion. For me that beat was this ramp and I’m grateful for all the good times and progression it’s allowed. To anyone reading don’t hinder yourself by believing that you’re too old for something or will never be as good as you once were. Just search for the right spark, everything and more is within you.

Now here I am 32 years young doing tricks that I couldn’t even do in my prime. \n\nIt’s interesting how we’re conditioned to think our abilities peak in youth and inevitably decline with age, as if talent follows a strict timeline. I’ve realized that being good at something isn’t just a phase, it’s a rhythm and sometimes it just takes the right beat to bring it back into motion. For me that beat was this ramp and I’m grateful for all the good times and progression it’s allowed. To anyone reading don’t hinder yourself by believing that you’re too old for something or will never be as good as you once were. Just search for the right spark, everything and more is within you. Working on a full mini ramp edit, but for now here’s a few tricks I’m proud of from the other day @nahmias__",

Do you agree? \n\nIt’s hard to remember this when people: \n\n- laugh at you when you make mistakes\n- say “I told you so”\n- talk about you behind your back \n- feel embarrassed being around you\n\nNo one likes being made fun of or feeling less than, but their feelings toward you is just a reflection of their lack of character. \n\nFailure is the prize not success. \n\nBecause when you know we are all beginners at something and we never fully “arrive” we can be ok with looking silly, making mistakes and not looking perfect all the time. \n\nYou are a human being. Not a perfect human at all times. There’s a difference. \n\nThis is my friendly reminder. Instead of beating yourself up when you fail… celebrate yourself for staying consistent and having the courage to work through the mistakes when most of the world sits on their couch and criticizes those who go for their dreams. \n\nMake sure to get your tickets to SummitofGreatness.com for our live 2 day event in Los Angeles next weekend to hear from the biggest speakers in the world and continue your journey to living your dreams!",

Above all, don't make the assumption of success every day. Things will go wrong.",
