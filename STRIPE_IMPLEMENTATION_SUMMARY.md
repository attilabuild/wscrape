## 🔄 User Flow

1. **New User Signs Up** → Redirected to `/pricing`
2. **User Clicks "Subscribe"** → Stripe Checkout opens
3. **Payment Successful** → Webhook creates subscription in database
4. **User Redirected** → `/dashboard?success=true`
5. **Dashboard Access** → Protected by subscription check
6. **Manage Subscription** → `/dashboard` → Billing tab → Stripe Customer Portal

---

## 🚀 Setup Steps (Quick Version)

### 1. Create Stripe Product & Price
```bash
# In Stripe Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Products → Add product
# 2. Name: "wscrape Pro"
# 3. Price: $29.99 USD monthly
# 4. Copy the Price ID (price_...)
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:
```env
# Stripe Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_your_price_id

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Your existing Supabase & OpenAI keys...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

### 3. Update Database Schema

Run `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the subscription tables.

### 4. Set Up Webhook (Local Development)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login
stripe login

# Forward webhooks
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Copy the webhook signing secret (whsec_...) to .env.local
```

### 5. Test with Test Cards

Use Stripe test card:
- Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Date: Any future date
- CVV: Any 3 digits
- ZIP: Any 5 digits

## 🔍 How It Works

### Access Control
1. User tries to access `/dashboard`
2. `ProtectedRoute` component checks:
   - ✅ User is authenticated
   - ✅ User has active subscription
   - ✅ Subscription is not expired
3. If no subscription → Redirect to `/pricing`
4. If has subscription → Allow access

### Subscription Management
1. User goes to `/dashboard` → Billing tab
2. Clicks "Manage Subscription"
3. Opens Stripe Customer Portal
4. Can update payment, view invoices, cancel subscription

### Webhook Events
When Stripe events happen, they're sent to `/api/webhooks/stripe`:
- **Payment Success** → Updates subscription status to "active"
- **Payment Failed** → Updates status to "past_due"
- **Subscription Canceled** → Updates status to "canceled"
- **Subscription Updated** → Updates period dates
